# Decentralized Health Intelligence Network (DHIN) White Paper

Explore the comprehensive white paper on the **Decentralized Health Intelligence Network (DHIN)**, a theoretical framework addressing significant challenges of health data sovereignty and AI utilization in healthcare.

## DHIN Abstract:
The **Decentralized Health Intelligence Network (DHIN)** is a framework designed to tackle the issues of data fragmentation across healthcare providers and institutions, which hinder effective AI utilization in healthcare. DHIN establishes a sovereign architecture for healthcare provision, making it a prerequisite for a sovereign health network. This enables effective AI use by overcoming barriers to accessing diverse medical data sources.

### Key Components:
1. **Self-Sovereign Identity Architecture**: Coupled with a personal health record (PHR) to establish health data sovereignty.
2. **Scalable Federated Learning (FL) Protocol**: Implemented on a public blockchain for decentralized AI training in healthcare, where health data remains with participants, sharing only model parameter updates.
3. **Scalable, Trustless Rewards Mechanism**: Incentivizes participation and ensures fair reward distribution without third-party interference.

This framework ensures that no entity can prevent or control access to health data for AI training or determine financial rewards. It supports effective AI training while maintaining patient control over their data, providing financial benefits, and contributing to a decentralized, scalable ecosystem. Patients receive rewards in their digital wallets as an incentive to opt-in to the FL protocol, with a long-term vision of funding decentralized insurance solutions. This novel, self-financed healthcare model adapts to individual needs, complements existing systems, and redefines universal coverage.
