# Welcome to Doctelligence ðŸš€

Doctelligence is a pioneering initiative dedicated to creating a self-sovereign healthcare network as a public good. Our mission is to enhance patient outcomes and global healthcare access through innovative technologies and decentralization.

### What We Do at the Foundation:
- ðŸ“Š Create a self-sovereign, decentralized healthcare network.
- ðŸ§¬ Employ blockchain and federated learning for secure AI model training.
- ðŸ’¡ Foster an ecosystem where patients are rewarded for their data contribution to fund health insurance.

The non-profit arm of Doctelligence is committed to decentralizing health data, enhancing patient outcomes, and expanding global access to healthcare. Our efforts align with the WHOâ€™s [Global Strategy on Digital Health 2020-2025](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240020924), promoting digital technologies to improve health worldwide, and [advancing Universal Health Coverage](https://www.who.int/europe/health-topics/universal-health-coverage) by making healthcare more accessible and equitable.

This work springs forth from the paper on the **Decentralized Health Intelligence Network (DHIN)**, a derivative use case of the **Decentralized Intelligence Network (DIN)**. The DIN works were presented at the Summit on Responsible Decentralized Intelligence - Future of Decentralization and AI, hosted by Berkeley RDI on August 6, 2024, at the Verizon Center, Cornell Tech Campus, Roosevelt Island, NYC.
