# Welcome to the Decentralized Intelligence Network (DIN) üöÄ

The Decentralized Intelligence Network (DIN) is an ambitious initiative dedicated to creating a self-sovereign ecosystem that transcends sectors. Our mission is to empower individuals and organizations through data sovereignty, scalable AI, and decentralized technologies, driving innovation and accessibility across various industries.

## What We Do at DIN:
- üõ°Ô∏è **Create a self-sovereign, decentralized network** that fosters trust and autonomy across different sectors.
- üìà **Leverage blockchain and federated learning** to enable secure and privacy-preserving AI model training.
- üåç **Promote an ecosystem where participants are rewarded** for contributing data, thereby fueling innovation and equity in various fields.

DIN is committed to decentralizing intelligence and enhancing outcomes across industries by aligning with global standards and frameworks. Our efforts support the advancement of digital technologies and their applications across diverse sectors, ensuring accessibility, equity, and innovation.

## Origins and Vision:
The Decentralized Intelligence Network (DIN) framework is the foundation for cross-sector applications, born from pioneering research in decentralized and privacy-preserving technologies. DIN works were showcased at the Summit on Responsible Decentralized Intelligence - Future of Decentralization and AI, hosted by Berkeley RDI on August 6, 2024, at the Verizon Center, Cornell Tech Campus, Roosevelt Island, NYC.
