“I founded Doctelligence because I saw a transformative opportunity at the intersection of technology and healthcare.”

As the sole Founder of Doctelligence and a PhD candidate in Computer Science at the University of Oxford, specializing in Human-Centred Computing, I am deeply involved in developing design principles for health data systems. These systems are designed to effectively utilize health data for AI applications, tackling key challenges in service delivery.

My unique background, combining clinical expertise and advanced knowledge of AI and ML technologies, has equipped me with the necessary skills to innovate healthcare solutions. With an MBBS from University of London and clinical experience as a medical doctor, as well as a Master's at the University of Cambridge where I applied ML diagnostics for clinical applications, I have combined my clinical expertise with advanced knowledge of AI and ML technologies to innovate healthcare solutions.

At Doctelligence, I lead efforts to create safe and reliable AI frameworks that standardize the integration of AI into public healthcare practices. Our mission is to develop standardized, safe, and reliable AI frameworks that revolutionize healthcare practices and improve patient outcomes.
