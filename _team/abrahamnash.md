“I founded Doctelligence because I saw a transformative opportunity at the intersection of technology and healthcare.”

As the sole Founder of Doctelligence and a PhD candidate in Computer Science at the University of Oxford, specializing in Human-Centred Computing, I am deeply involved in developing design principles for health data systems. These systems are designed to effectively utilize health data for AI applications, tackling key challenges in service delivery.

With a background as a medical doctor and a Master’s in applying ML diagnostics for clinical applications from the University of Cambridge, I combine my clinical expertise with advanced AI and ML technologies to innovate healthcare solutions. At Doctelligence, I lead efforts to create safe and reliable AI frameworks that standardize the integration of AI into public healthcare practices, focusing on enhancing diagnostic and therapeutic efficiencies.

My practical experience includes my time as a Junior Doctor in the NHS, where I gained valuable insights into the medical field, which now inform my approach to AI-driven healthcare improvements. My leadership at Doctelligence aims to bridge the gap between complex AI technologies and everyday clinical applications, ensuring that healthcare providers can deliver superior care with improved outcomes.
