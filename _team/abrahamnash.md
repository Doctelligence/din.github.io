“I founded Doctelligence because I saw a transformative opportunity at the intersection of technology and healthcare.”

As the sole founder and a PhD candidate in Computer Science at the University of Oxford, specializing in Human-Centred Computing, I specialize in creating effective health data systems for AI applications. These systems address key challenges in healthcare delivery.

My background uniquely equips me for this role. With an MBBS from the University of London and clinical experience as a medical doctor, combined with a Master's from the University of Cambridge where I applied machine learning to clinical diagnostics, I bridge the gap between medicine and technology.

At Doctelligence, I lead the development of AI frameworks that ensure safety, reliability, and standardization in public healthcare. Our mission drives us to innovate and enhance healthcare solutions for better patient outcomes.
